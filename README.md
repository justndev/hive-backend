# Hive Backend

This repository is part of the backend of my first full-featured project "Hive". It uses Spring boot, WebSockets and security, JWT, and custom services for instant messaging, registration, and publishing messages. I want to acknowledge to the reader that this is my first Spring boot project. Moreover, it will serve as a basis for the current complex project.
